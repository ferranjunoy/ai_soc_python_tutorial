This code philosophy continues to influence the design and implementation of Python code today, and it is worth bearing in mind."

    "# Thank you!\n",
    "\n",
    "Thank you so much for following this part of the tutorial. There is a lot of material here to digest, but you've absolutely got this!\n",
    "\n",
    "Take your time to go through the examples and experiment. In fact, you can create and edit your own code blocks in this very Jupyter notebook and experiment alongside the examples we have included! The best way to learn and internalise all this information is to put it into practice.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are hungry to learn more about software engineering, reach out to us! In the meantime, you might want to look into some other coding principles that are important to writing clean code, such as defining clean **interfaces** between layers of our applications, the ideas of **abstraction** and **encapsulation**, and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "Writing production-ready software can be a complex process, involving stages such as the following:\n",
    "- understanding users' requirements (possibly thinking about both functional and non-functional requirements using the MoSCoW method);\n",
    "- designing and architecting a solution (what are the different components of your system? how do they interact and scale?);\n",
    "- user interface and experience design;\n",
    "- implementation (what technologies are the right tool to solve this problem? how can you write code that is easy to maintain, test and validate the correctness of?);\n",
    "- testing (unit testing, integration testing & end-to-end testing);\n",
    "- debugging (fixing parts of the codebase that do not work as intended);\n",
    "- static analysis (can we find and correct errors in our code at build-time?);\n",
    "- and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "Understandably, you might wish to jump straight into learning about the latest and greatest machine learning models (as you will be able to in our upcoming tutorials!), but spending the time now to get a _solid_ foundation in Python and and perhaps ideas from software engineering more broadly can be a fulfilling way of setting yourself up to tackle larger challenges.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to learn more about computer science, an excellent introduction is Harvard's [CS50](https://www.edx.org/cs50). They also have a 10-week course that focuses specifically on teaching Python, [CS50P](https://www.edx.org/course/cs50s-introduction-to-programming-with-python), rather than on computer science more broadly."
